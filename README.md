The program catches pictures from links like goo.gl/tehuPH and downloads them using wget. (You may change wget.exe in downloader.php file to your own operation system compatible one)

If you're using the program in the current year (till 1393), just use the command `php downloader.php`, but for updating lists, delete `out` directory and use `php main.php`, then use `php downloader.php` for downloading'em.

- The output directory is `files` folder.
